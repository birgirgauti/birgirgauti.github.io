    <p>Overall Rating: 5</p>

    <p>The Alabama state website is my favorite website out of the five. It was a close call between Alabama and Massachusetts. I like the colors and simplicity of the Alabama website. Personally, I'm a very minimalistic person, I like the simple white and dark blue, it's a classic and good combo that you can't really go wrong with. When it comes to the design of the front page itself, the way we jump straight into a search bar is nice and the overlap in the design is very neat. For example, where "Popular with our Citizens:" section overlaps with the search section. Helpful links, are featured below that, very nice. The menu is nice. Looks good. Most of the options in the menu are loading relatively fast, can't complain. The formatting of font, search bars, etc. for both web and mobile is nice. Lastly, at the bottom of the page they have the necessities, such as contact us and all that good stuff.</p>

    <p>Overall Rating: 4.7</p>

    <p>Massachusetts, coming in at a strong 4.7. I almost put this one in first place but the last "look-over" settled it for me, I think overall the website is pleasing to the eye but they random green font and green arrows within the white and blue design is horrible. Also, a problem for me with the design is the size of the "Welcome to Massachusetts" search section, I feel like I'm losing track of where I am because that one section is taking over my entire screen. Other than those 2 design mistakes I don't see much wrong with the page, the menu is nicely setup, runs fast, they have alerts at the top of the page which I personally think is annoying but I'll let it slide because I also think that it's important. I like that you can change the language and have Google translate it. Means that it's very foreigner friendly. Both, "Featured services" and "News and Updates" seems reasonable where they are. The site formats well when put into mobile view. The menu folds nicely at the top. Lastly, same as the Alabama website, the footer at the bottom of the page has the necessities which I like.</p>

    <p>Overall Rating: 3.3</p>

    <p>This one gets a rating of 3.3. This is mainly because of the ridiculous color decisions on this webpage. Again, the blue, white, and green is not doing it for me, the gradient blue, purple, and red covid-19 alerts looks aweful and out of place. The pictures of fall themed leaves almost looks as bad as one of the website we made in class ;-) I also don't really understand the reasoning behind the duplicate search bars, either have it in the top right corner, or in the middle of the screen. Seems like a waste of space. This webpage still gets an average rating because the fundamentals of it are alright. Despite the menus looking bad, the drop down is neat and easy to navigate. The site runs smooth, the sections on the site are reasonably laid out. However, I wish that we would be able to click anywhere on the boxes within the "Connect with Government" section, like on the picture. We see this in the section above called "Popular Resources". Other than that, once again they have the footer setup nicely, easily navigated. And mobile formatting is done correctly.</p>

    <p>Overall Rating: 0.1</p>

    <p>I wish I could say nothing about this one. That's how horrible it is. First of all, why would anyone in Alaska want to know how to say "Hello, how are you?" in Deg Xinag. I might be uninformed but to me it seems like the stupidest "fact of the day" type of thing ever. The color coding again is horrible, different shades of blue all over the page. The rounding of sections looks horrible. The use of emojis in "latest news" section, seems unprofessional. Whoever made this website really likes gradient. All buttons and clickable boxes are all gradient. The reason this website doesn't get a 0 and actually gets a 0.1 is because I actually like the dropdown, they have a nice footer and the website runs pretty fast. However, mobile formatting is not good, scrolling to the sides to access information, etc. This website does not get their logo showcased on my state website review website because their website is horrible. I also don't like the fact that "myAlaska" is camelcased. Looks like an error, but there might be some reason behind it.</p>

    <p>Overall Rating: 0</p>

    <p>This one gets a rating of 0. Absolutely dreadful design, rounded edges, bad choice of colors, probably five different types of blue, the font looks ugly, when you hover over the menu items they have some weird and uneven red barriers at the top and bottom of that menu item. In the top left we can see a logo somehow shaded behind the text and the top section and I have absolutely no idea who thought that was a good idea. Mobile formatting is not good on this, we have to scroll to the side to see the webpage. If you type something into the search bar and click enter, the actual search result page is so bad that the NH.gov logo is sitting ontop of the menu. The footer is not nice, there is very limited into there. Ontop of all this, the website is slow. Overall. Horrible experience.</p>
