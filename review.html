        <h1><a href="https://www.landsbankinn.is/" style=color:red;>Landsbankinn</a></h1>
        <p style=color:red;>Landsbankinn's website is very pleasing to the eye. They have everything a banking website could ever need. They have a nice navigation menu with hover effects. You log into your account in the top right corner. The main info is right there on the front page, such as, latest news, currency converter between relevant currencies in Iceland, Covid-19 information. These are all split into different sections so there is no confusion about what info belongs to which section. This website does use basic html5 elements. It does seem clean from what I can tell, although it is pretty advanced. Looking at the code for just the front page it seems like they reference links that include a lot of the elements on the page. For example, the currency exchange section looks like a table. However, in the developer tools there is no evidence that suggest a list. The layout makes perfect sense to me, the information seems to be ranked from most important to least important. First is log in, at the top which is useful because most people visiting the website are most likely going to check out their bank account. Second is currency converter which is also useful because personally, if I ever go on that website it's see the conversion rates for USD to ISK. Third is news and notifications. It seems to be a block by block layout. Yes you can scroll. The navigation around the website is nice, the navigation section at the top is simple, straight to the point and the "personal" option has a nice and well labeled drop down if you need to further specify your search. This website uses 2 major colors I would say. Dark blue and white. This fits them very well because their while theme is dark blue, their logo has a dark blue background with a red figure on the front. Their banks (in person) are all blue. Therefore, I think these colors fit them very well. The usage of white is just for visual pleasure since blue and white tend to go well together. What sets this website apart from the other is their simplicity, the clear defined sections, split up by the background color. The website as a whole is just super simple to use, the "Make an appointment" button is super useful since that's a big part of visiting a bank website, most of the time you need further assistance or "admin" assistance for a problem or such.</p>

        <h1><a href="https://www.fourseasons.com/" style=color:white;>Four Seasons</a></h1>
        <p style=color:white;>I love this website because it's aesthetically pleasing. You open it up and you're hit with a beautiful video of four seasons resorts around the world. This sets the website apart from the other websites. After looking at the code, although it is advanced and hard to understand it seems to be in order or clean. They do use HTML5, but lay their code out a little differently than we do in class. I really like how they keep each element on one line. Instead of pressing enter and writing something in the line between the elements. They don't have any tables on this front page. The layout of the website does make sense to me, when you open it up we have that instant "check rates" button which is very straight to the point. In the navigation you can choose what you're here for, whether that's hotels and resorts or private retreats, etc. Below all that there's more resorts advertising, as well as property renting and on and on. Looking at the code they seem to use a lot of iframe elements, after looking up what that is I can see that they're embedding other documents within their front page html document. The navigation is very nice. Click on your interest and you are taken to a different page with everything you might want to know about your selection. Their main colors are black and white, the website has a very dark look when you open it up which I really like it showcases a sort of luxurious and elite organization. Their logo is black and white which makes sense for the color selection. What this website does well being asthetically pleasing. Their use of pictures and videos gets you really invested in what they are offering.</p>

        <h1><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" style=color:darkgreen>Yale School of Art</a></h1>
        <p style=color:darkgreen>I really don't know what to say about this one. I simply can't understand how someone thought this would be a good idea. It seems like they went for that artsy look but it just hasn't worked out whatsoever. I like art and everything but sometimes they just think they can make something ugly, put a little bit of pride in it and think that everyone else is going to join their pride and think their creation is amazing. This is possibly the worst website I have ever seen in my entire life. I have been asking my friends and family about what they think about this website and I've gotten the same responses from them. The background color is each work, the underlined text, the address, the DAMN BACKGROUND, I don't even want to get started on that. This website looks like a little child headbutted the keyboard a bunch of times. I also really hate the gradient. They do seem to use HTML5 however. They don't have any tables that I'm aware of or can see, their code also does not suggest that. Sure, I'm going to have to admit despite hating the website that the layout is very straight to the point, their "quick links" do make sense even thought they're ugly. They have a link to apply to the school, read more about the school, news, gallery, you basically get to all the info you might need on this website. What doesn't make sense is the "pause animations" button. Either keep the animations or remove them, simple. Bottom line, navigation is satisfactory. Their two major colors seem to be blue and yellow. The Yale University colors are blue and yellow, their logo is very blue with hints of white and yellow so yes, I think this fits theis audience very well. Everything sets this website apart from other websites, in all the wrong ways. The animated background, the use of background-color on what seems like h1,2,3,etc. elements, aswell on paragraph elements. Their use of gradient is unseen in our modern society. I guess what they do well and the only thing they do well is how easily navigated their website is. They have information split into sections and such. </p>
